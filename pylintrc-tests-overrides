[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable the message(s) with the given id(s).
# In addition to regularly disabled messages, also
# disable the following:
#   :C0111: *Missing docstring*
#       Reason: We don't want to document test files. When the
#       tests are run, the docstring will be displayed instead of
#       the name of the test.
#   :R0201: *Method could be a function*
#       Reason: Tests that use `mod.some_function.calls()` to
#       assert that a function call was made will trigger this
#       message, but are valid tests.
#   :W0212: *Access to a protected member %s of a client class*
#       Reason: It is often necessary to access protected
#       members in tests.
#   :E1120: *No value passed for parameter %s in function call*
#       Reason: When using Dingus, we often reference the
#       result of a function call as `self.module.some_function()`
#       which is valid, but causes this message to appear.
#   :W0703: *Catch "Exception" Used when an except catches Exception instances*
#       Reason: Within our unit tests we often catch a general exception
#       then check various aspects about that error.
#   :R0904: *Too many public methods (%s/%s)*
#       Reason: Inheriting from unittest2.TestCase will trigger this message.
